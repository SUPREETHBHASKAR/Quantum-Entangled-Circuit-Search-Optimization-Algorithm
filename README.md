# Quantum-Entangled-Circuit-Search-Optimization-Algorithm
It is a Novel Algorithm for combinatorial optimization where the search is done by entanglement driven sampling.

The main files are clean modified funceval and new stratregy modified funceval, any of them can be used to solve the problem. There are three files that generate the data for the knapsack problem (combinatorial problem): uncorrealted, weakly correlated, and strongly correlated data. There is also a capacity ratio file that gives the desired capacity for a given set of data. The generated data should be input to the main files.
